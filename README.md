# Generic App Template
This repo contains some starter code that I wrote that can be used as a template for new projects. The idea is all the code in here is generic and reusable. Currently there are 3 main components to highlight:

1. A customizable header with an avatar icon and a settings menu drawer on click
2. A drawer menu with placeholder tab names
3. A grid layout with 4 items inside as placeholders (this is dynamically moved by drawer menu onOpen)

# Future Items
1. The highest priority future item is an authentication framework including:
   a. Use of rbac roles
   b. User creation workflow
   c. Login workflow
2. Code clean up is another high priority item. All current components work properly but since this was made in a rush there is some styling issues as well as unconventional solutions 
   that could use some improvement.
